# Cobo

This is the main branch. Please make sure that when you merge or add any files they go in the correct place. Any python scripts should be placed in the src folder. Don't worry about the CMake or Package files or the srv folder. The name of the ROS package here is sdp (all lower) and that should be used when accessing any resources assocatied with the project (mainly when using services).

Any questions about the project layout should be directed to Martin.
